"Here I go again, the wind at my back, come around, get close, I will tell you a story."
"I will need a haircut soon, it's flying around like crazy, who will cut it? I have no money, what can I do, can you help?"
"I can smell the salt in the wind, can you?"
"I hate getting my feet wet, takes ages for my socks to dry, but its ok, I am nicely put here, I can deal."
"I need to drink a lot, otherwise I will grow short, not broad and full - lets have a drink."
I've had a great micro-organic workout. God I need a drink.
"Sometimes this water, it just runs anywhere it wants to. As the caretaker here, I need to take care of it, wash and dry the earth."
"Yuk, who threw this crap here, I need to mess with it, what crap. Crappy, bloody humans."
"I take all particles, all smells, all the aromas of the world, turn them into sweet perfume!"
"The air, the water, the waste, I sit here writing poetry, polluting with prose, cleaning the page, write in life again."
"Falling, everything is falling, you know, monkeys fall from the heavens. I rake it in, I take it in, you know?"
"Just a bit, swept here by the wind, knocks against me, a standing bulldozer here I am, holding you back."
"What kind of scarecrow am I? Not human for sure! I am a snake maybe, scaring the earth from leaving."
"Its like having a backache, and these worms, they wriggle and massage me."
"So many organisms, so many insects, so many rats and not enough time!"
"Like being a dwarf, or the seven dwarfs, or the million dwarfs, ants, bugs, fungi, we go to work, we work all day. In Sweden!"
"As the chemist here, look all around, here are my bottles and jars, my chemicals, my scales and eyeglass. What can I do for you?"
"None of bottles of medicine get old, but you need to take care. To feed the flowers and water the soil."
"Rheumatism, jaundice, abdominal pain or warts and boils. Let me wash and salve, let me save you."
"Psst, come here, I got somethin' special 'ere, under my coat, take a look! Sweet huh?"
"Cloud berries,  blueberries, bog bilberries, arctic bramble, dewberries and rowanberries... more more here, more.."
"Look I know you are going drinking tonight, its ok, I understand, you're only human. How about some St John's wart in that?"
"We got them, yeah. No, I won't tell you what they are. Where? Just look for them yourself, you lazy sod."
"Humans, they come here, they steal my precious flowers, don't care, bloody snooty thieves, think they own the world."
"I have lived my life with flowers in my hair. Flowers, in my hair. Sing with me. Nonsense, all nonsense, no way I'm a hippy."
"OW! DId you see that? That bloody rabbit took a nip at me. Are you a cow? I hope not, they tend to munch on me a bit."
"Do you have a dog? If you do, can you get it to catch the rabbits? They really take me down."
"Bees, we've got bees, and wasps and mosquitos too. The mosquitos scare the humans, 'cause who else will save the bees?"
"The bees do it, the birds come and eat the berries, then they do it, the snakes and hares do it. Its an orgy."
"The fox and the rabbit, the bird and the worm, the snake and the mouse, the human and the?"
"Over there, do you see them? They are like me, I need to go over there too, we need to be together, to connect, to be."
"These grubs, when they grow up, they will be warriors, an army, to take on the pests on the barley, the buckwheat and rye."
"No, yes. You can pick the apples, the rose hips, the pear - but wait until I tell you"
"I will show you how to take care of the seeds, dry them and keep them close, then plant them again."
"Can collect your dog's urine for me, dilute it with 10 parts water, and feed it to me? Yummy!"
"So busy around here, you'd think we were in a city, did you see that mouse?"
"When it rains its so dark. I like it when there's sun here, when there is sun here."
"Humid. Its so wet after all this rain. My plants are my umbrella, my snails my roof."
Its getting warmer here. I can wear flowery t-shirts.
